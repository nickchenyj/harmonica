Todo List:
  . Create register files/issue logic
    - No need for a forwarding network or hazard detection. This is all handled
      by scoreboarding.
    - Must perform writeback in a single cycle to avoid need for forwarding
      (then forwarding can all be internal to the register file).
    - Remember to forward through register (and valid bit) files appropriately.
  . Create functional unit interface
  . Create a basic ALU functional unit
  . Create writeback logic
  _ Create selective functional unit stall logic.
      - Say 2 FUs finish their op at the same time. Stall the one that doesn't
        get to write back.
  . Create branch determination logic
  _ Add forwarding to accelerate critical loops.
    - The basic problem is that decode-execute requires at least 2 cycles, but
      we have enough information in the decode stage that we could forward the
      value from writeback to execute in the next cycle.
  . Create a basic load/store unit
    - Just a simple SRAM with no MMU for now.
  _ Create a FxPU/FPU
