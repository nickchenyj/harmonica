Todo List:
  _ Add forwarding logic.
    - The basic problem is that decode-execute requires at least 2 cycles, but
      we have enough information in the decode stage that we could forward the
      value from writeback to execute at the beginning of the next cycle.
  _ Add branch prediction
  _ Create a load/store unit that interfaces to a cache.
  _ Create an integer multiplication and division unit.
  _ Create a pipelined FxPU or FPU.
  _ Add kernel mode.
  _ Add support for interrupts/exceptions (including shadow register file).
  _ Add support for multiple SIMD lanes.
  _ Write a test app. Likely to be most fun: SIMD mandelbrot zoomer with text
    graphics output.
